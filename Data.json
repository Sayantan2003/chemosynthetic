        "length": "Up to 2.4 meters (7.9 feet)",
        "color": "Bright red plume; white tube-shaped body",
        "features": "Giant tube worms have no mouth, no digestive tract, and instead absorb nutrients through a symbiotic relationship with chemosynthetic bacteria."
      },
      "habitat": {
        "location": "Hydrothermal vents along mid-ocean ridges",
        "depth_range": "1000-1500 meters"
      },
      "diet_and_feeding_habits": "Giant tube worms rely on symbiotic bacteria that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to provide nutrients, as they do not have a digestive system.",
      "reproduction": "Reproduction occurs through external fertilization, where both sperm and eggs are released into the water column, and larvae develop before settling on the ocean floor near vents.",
      "ecological_role": "Giant tube worms serve as primary producers in deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems. They provide essential nutrients through chemosynthesis, which supports higher organisms in the food chain.",
      "interesting_facts": "Giant tube worms can survive in environments with extreme temperatures, up to 176°F (80°C), and where hydrogen sulfide, typically toxic to most organisms, is abundant.",
      "space_relevance": "Their reliance on chemosynthesis for energy makes giant tube worms potential models for life in environments where sunlight is absent, such as on icy moons like Europa or Enceladus, where similar chemical processes could support life."

      "diet_and_feeding_habits": "Zoarcid fish are predators that feed on vent shrimp, worms, and other small organisms found around hydrothermal vents. They also scavenge dead organisms that have fallen to the ocean floor.",
      "reproduction": "Zoarcid fish lay their eggs in crevices near hydrothermal vents. The eggs are protected in these crevices until they hatch, and the larvae emerge as miniature versions of the adults.",
      "ecological_role": "Zoarcid fish are predators that help control the populations of vent organisms, contributing to the balance of the deep-sea food web. They also serve as prey for larger species.",
      "interesting_facts": "Zoarcid fish can live up to 10 years in the harsh conditions of hydrothermal vent ecosystems, showing remarkable adaptations to high pressures and low temperatures.",
      "space_relevance": "Zoarcid fish are of interest to astrobiologists studying the possibility of life in extreme environments. Their survival in low-light, high-pressure habitats offers insights into how life could persist on icy moons like Europa or in other subsurface oceans."

      "reproduction": "Reproduction in Pompeii worms occurs through external fertilization. The worms release eggs and sperm into the water, where larvae develop before settling near hydrothermal vents.",
      "ecological_role": "Pompeii worms are considered pioneer species in vent ecosystems, providing a habitat for other organisms such as bacteria, which are a crucial part of the chemosynthetic food web.",
      "interesting_facts": "Pompeii worms are among the most heat-tolerant animals on Earth, capable of surviving in temperatures as high as 80°C (176°F).",

      "ecological_role": "As detritivores, giant isopods play a vital role in deep-sea ecosystems by recycling nutrients from dead organisms, supporting the benthic food web.",
      "interesting_facts": "Giant isopods can survive for months without food, thanks to their slow metabolism and the scarcity of resources in the deep sea. They can also roll into a ball, like terrestrial pillbugs, for protection from predators.",
